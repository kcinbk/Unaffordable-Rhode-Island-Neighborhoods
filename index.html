    <h1>Rhode Island's Unaffordable Neigborhoods </h1>
    
    <p> Between 2021 and 2023, Rhode Island recorded over 23,000 eviction filings, 
        according to data tracked by The Eviction Lab at Princeton University. 
        And like much of the US, a large share of renters say they are experience 
        rent burdened, paying at least 30 percent of their household income for rent. 
        Some even pay rent takes up 50 percent or more of their paychecks each month. </p>
        
    <br>
    
    <p class="second"> The following map and table are based on data from Census Bureau's 
        most recent American Community Survey and eviction filing collected by Princeton's 
        Eviction Lab. Python codes and other supporting files can be found in this
